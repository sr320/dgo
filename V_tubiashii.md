#_Vibrio tubiashii_
As part of a Saltonstahl Kennedy funded project entitled "insert name" several genomic libraries were generated and sequenced. Two different strains were partially sequenced in an effort to learn what genetic differences might be associated with different phenotypes (growth) under ocean acidification conditions. 

According to the our records the first library we every sequenced was *Vibrio tubiashi*. Don't know much about it we call it 'mRNA' and the facility tube labeling indicated "Vibrio (our writing) Lib 1/23/09 DB 7.82ng/uL 200bp". 


The next occurance of this taxa was not until years later with two genomic DNA libraries: RE22 and XXXXX? These were SOLiD libraries sequenced in early 2011. This effort was part of the thesis work of Elene Dorfmeier. A detailed description of her work with respect to these libaries can be found in her thesis <add link>. Page-- Raw data is available in SRA?? and a lot of secondary analysis files are available via figshare.
