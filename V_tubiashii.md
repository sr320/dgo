#_Vibrio tubiashii_

According to the our records the first library we ever sequenced was from *Vibrio tubiashi*. The experiment compared transcriptomic changes in _V.tubiashii_ exposed to autoclaved _C.gigas_ and those that were not.  Samples were incubated in sterile seawater (with or without autoclaved _C.gigas_) for 24hrs. at room temperature, at a concentration of 9.975x10^11 CFU/mL.  After 24hrs., _V.tubiashii_ concentrations were calculated and two 50mL volumes were collected from each treatment.  Cells were pelleted, supernatant removed and the pellets were stored @ -80C.

Total RNA was isolated from the control (5.63 x 10^11 CFU) and exposed (1.835 x 10^12 CFU) _V.tubiashii_ samples using 10mL of TriReagent.  The remainder of the manufacturer's protocol was scaled appropriately.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed from each samples using the MICROBExpress Kit (Ambion), accoriding to the manufacturer's protocol.  Removal of rRNA from each sample was verified via formaldehyde-HEPES agarose gel and compared with untreated total RNA from each sample.  Submitted just the _C.gigas_-exposed mRNA for single-end Illumina sequencing at the HTGU (University of Washington).


Don't know much about it, but we called it 'mRNA' and the facility tube labeling indicated "Vibrio Lib 1/23/09 DB 7.82ng/uL 200bp".

As part of a Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant funded project entitled "_Ocean acidification and emerging diseases in the Pacific Northwest_" genomic libraries were generated and sequenced. Two different strains were partially sequenced in an effort to learn what genetic differences might be associated with different phenotypes (ie growth) under ocean acidification conditions. 



The next occurance of this taxa was not until years later with two genomic DNA libraries: RE22 and XXXXX? These were SOLiD libraries sequenced in early 2011. 

This effort was part of the thesis work of Elene Dorfmeier. The thesis, "_Ocean acidification and disease: How will a changing climate impact Vibrio tubiashii growth and pathogenicity to Pacific oyster larvae?_" is [available online](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/20742/Dorfmeier_washington_0250O_10226.pdf?sequence=1)

 A detailed description of her work with respect to these libaries can be found in her thesis <add link>. Page-- Raw data is available in SRA?? and a lot of secondary analysis files are available via figshare.
