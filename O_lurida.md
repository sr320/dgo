#_Ostrea lurida_ (Olympia oyster)
Olympia oyster sequencing efforts have spawned from studies examining the influence of ocean acidification and a study examining local adaptation in Puget Sound. As of March 2014 the libraries constructed and sequence include the following

|       ID | Stage | Notes[^1]|
|------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
|Ol-larv 400_1 | larvae  | 0112; 012159; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 2000_1 | larvae  | 0112; 012159; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 400_2 | larvae  | 0812; 103939; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 1000_2 | larvae  | 0812; 103939; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 1600_2 | larvae  | 0812; 103939; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 2200_2 | larvae  | 0812; 103939; 36SE|

Libraries Ol-larv 400_1 and Ol-larv 2000_1 were described as part of the publication:   
**Timmins-Schiffman, E. B., Friedman, C. S., Metzger, D. C., White, S. J. and Roberts, S. B. (2013), Genomic resource development for shellfish of conservation concern. Molecular Ecology Resources, 13: 295–305. doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.12052**

>Larvae were transferred to the University of Washington 12 h post spawning. Larvae (12 larvae/mL) were evenly distributed to six 4.5-L larval chambers. Larvae were sampled from all chambers by filtering them onto a 35 μm screen and flash freezing in liquid N2 on days one, two and three post-fertilization. Two RNA-seq libraries (Ol-larv 400_1 and Ol-larv 2000_1) were constructed from pooled mRNA (13 μg per sample).

In order to characterize the reproductive transcriptome of the Olympia oyster four libraries were made in from pooled gonad samples. The ideas were 106A_Female, 106A_Male, 108A_Female, 108A_Female.
<insert description of what went into these libraries>

 These libraries were done in late 2012 and were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeqplatform on a 72PE run. An additional run was performed at XXSE as bonus.
