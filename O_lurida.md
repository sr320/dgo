#_Ostrea lurida_ (Olympia oyster)
Olympia oyster sequencing efforts have spawned from studies examining the influence of ocean acidification and a study examining local adaptation in Puget Sound. As of March 2014 the libraries constructed and sequence include the following

|Ol-larv 400_1 | larvae  | 0112; 012159; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 2000_1 | larvae  | 0112; 012159; 36SE|
|Ol-larv 400_2 | larvae  | 0812; 103939; 36SE|

Libraries Ol-larv 400_1 and Ol-larv 2000_1 were described as part of the publication:   
**Timmins-Schiffman, E. B., Friedman, C. S., Metzger, D. C., White, S. J. and Roberts, S. B. (2013), Genomic resource development for shellfish of conservation concern. Molecular Ecology Resources, 13: 295–305. doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.12052**

>Larvae were transferred to the University of Washington 12 h post spawning. Larvae (12 larvae/mL) were evenly distributed to six 4.5-L larval chambers. Larvae were sampled from all chambers by filtering them onto a 35 μm screen and flash freezing in liquid N2 on days one, two and three post-fertilization. Two RNA-seq libraries (Ol-larv 400_1 and Ol-larv 2000_1) were constructed from pooled mRNA (13 μg per sample).

In late 2012, four more libraries were made and sequenced, however this time these libraries were all run in a single lane on the Illumina HiSeq.

In order to characterize the reproductive transcriptome of the Olympia oyster four libraries were made in from pooled gonad samples. The ideas were 106A_Female, 106A_Male, 108A_Female, 108A_Female.
<insert description of what went into these libraries>

 These libraries were done in late 2012 and were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeqplatform on a 72PE run. An additional run was performed at XXSE as bonus.
