#_Ostrea lurida_ (Olympia oyster)
Olympia oyster sequencing efforts have spawned from studies examining the influence of ocean acidification and a study examining local adaptation in Puget Sound. As of March 2014 the libraries constructed and sequence include the following

In order to characterize the reproductive transcriptome of the Olympia oyster four libraries were made in from pooled gonad samples. The ideas were 106A_Female, 106A_Male, 108A_Female, 108A_Female.
<insert description of what went into these libraries>

 These libraries were done in late 2012 and were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeqplatform on a 72PE run. An additional run was performed at XXSE as bonus.
