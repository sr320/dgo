#Introduction
  Over the past several years our lab has experimented with a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms with the ultimate goal of addressing important scientific questions. On a few occasions we have been successful. Some of our early work included Roche 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing used to examine phenotypic plasticity in lake trout \cite{GOETZ_ROSAUER_SITAR_GOETZ_SIMCHICK_ROBERTS_JOHNSON_MURPHY_BRONTE_MACKENZIE_2010}, identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in salmon \cite{SEEB_PASCAL_GRAU_SEEB_TEMPLIN_HARKINS_ROBERTS_2011} and develop genomic resources for Pacific herring \cite{Roberts_Hauser_Seeb_Seeb_2012}.

  However there are a number of efforts that have failed early on (_ie_ poor read quality) or just never gained enough momentum to see the light of the peer-review system. This paper is a final attempt to share these datasets in a manner where they have the potenial, however slim, to be useful to someone. We will not be providing fluffy background or in-depth over-analysis but strive to offer a sound _data description_. This current work will be organized by target species, which will often correspond to project.
  
  
  Species include  
  - _Vibrio tubiashii_ 
  - Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_)
  - Yellow Perch (_Perca flavescens_)  
  - Pacific herring (_Clupea pallasii_)
  - Abalone / Withering Syndrome (WS)
  - Hard clam (_Mercenaria mercenaria_)
