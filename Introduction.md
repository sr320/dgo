#Introduction
  Over the past several years our lab has experimented with a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms with the ultimate goal of addressing important scientific questions. On a few occasions we have been successful. Below is a table of some of these products.

  However there are a number of efforts that have failed early on (ie poor read quality) or just never gained enough momentum to see the light of a the peer-review system. This paper is a final attempt to share these datasets in a manner where they have the potenial, however slim, to be useful to someone. We will not be providing fluffy background or in-depth over-analysis but strive to offer a sound 'methods' and 'results' section if you are consider a conventional paper, which this not. This current work will be organized by tareget species, which will often correspond to progject.
  
  
  Species include  
  - Vibrio tubiashii  
  - Ostrea lurida  
  - Perca  
  - Herring
