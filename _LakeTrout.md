#Lake Trout
All of our lake trout studies have been in collaboration with Dr. Rick Goetz, Research Physiologist, NOAA. 

Chronologically speaking, the first two libraries' FTLS were "Lean (our writing) mRNA SEQ 200bp Roberts lab 3ng/uL" and "Siscowets (our writing) mRNA SEQ 200bp Roberts lab 6.24ng/uL".
